					“What is HTTP and HTTPS?” – an overview of the protocol <br><br>
					Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or its abbreviation “HTTP” is a protocol used
					 to transmit data across the web, and it is considered to be the foundation
					  of the World Wide Web. HTTP is a client/server protocol where the client
					   requests, receives and displays web objects while the server sends objects 
					   in response to those requests. Protocols control the sending and receiving 
					   of messages and define their format, order and actions to be taken. For example,
					    when you open Google Chrome and search up “youtube.com” into your address bar, 
						your internet browser will use HTTP to send a message/request to a server, saying
						 that you would like to access YouTube. Then, the server sends the web page for 
						 YouTube back to your internet browser in response, also by using HTTP. This is 
						 called the request-response model. A client (your browser for example) sends a request 
						 to the server, which then the server responds to that request with the source that 
						 the client wants; which usually is an HTML document. HTTPS on the other hand is very 
						 similar to HTTP but, with additional security. HTTPS uses encryption protocols such as 
						 TLS and SSL to scramble the data, making it harder for that personal data to be stolen
						  by a third party.. HTTPS also authenticates and keeps data integrity so that there is
						   a form of personal identification and that malicious attacks are prevented. HTTPS
						    stops website information from being shown in such a way that it is easy to be seen 
							by any person who is snooping around on the network. As an example, let's say you had
							 a string of text which said what your bank account details were. After encryption,
							  those details would be completely changed to the point where you think that it’s just
							   a bunch of random, nonsensical characters. HTTP uses port 80 while HTTPS uses port 443. 
							   Ports are the virtual point where network connections start and end. If your computer is
							    network connected, then it’s exposing a number of ports which enables it to receive internet 
								traffic. Depending on the process/service and protocol being used, there are different ports.
