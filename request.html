					“What is a request?” – describe the format of an HTTP request as well as you can, and include a description of common error codes <br><br>
					An HTTP request is the message sent by the client to the server to request for some information that they need. The format of an HTTP request includes the following: an HTTP version type, a URL, an HTTP method, some HTTP request headers which give information about what the request is and what data is being sent and optionally an HTTP body. These messages make it easy for people to understand what is being requested.
					For the server to respond to the client, there are HTTP response status codes; here are a few categories of them 
					and the most common status codes you’re likely to see. If the status code starts with a 2, then it indicates success.
					 A common example of this is the status code 200, which means that the client’s request was a success and that the 
					 server has sent back the data requested by the client. If the status code starts with a 3, then that means that there
					  has been a redirection of some resource. An example of this is the status code 301, which means that the resource
					   requested has been permanently moved to a different URL. If the status code stars with a 4, then that means that an 
					   error has occurred with the client. Two examples of this is the status code 400, which means that the client typed 
					   something wrong; there was incorrect syntax, and the server could not make sense of what the client was trying to request.
					    Another one is the status code 404, which means that the resource that the client requested for could not be found on the
						 server. One final category of status codes are when they start with 5. This means that the server has had an error. An
						  example of a server error is status code 505, which is when the server does not support the current HTTP protocol version
						  that is being used by the client’s request.
